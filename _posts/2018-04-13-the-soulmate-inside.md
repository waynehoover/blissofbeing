title: "The Soulmate Inside"
---

I am grateful, I am grateful we have found each other, I am grateful we continue to find each other.

Iâ€™m grateful we continue to find each other inside ourselves. You are my soulmate, and I know because I found you inside first. What a joy it is to see you in the physical now too. As we continue to find each other inside we continue to see each other outside. We are a reflection of each other.

I have so much gratitude for the inner work we do. We continue to find each other inside so that we may continue to find each other outside.

This work we do, finding each other inside, feeds on itself. It is amazingly beautiful watching the way love builds on itself growing stronger without any outside fuel, love is like fusion. The more I see you inside the more I see you reflected outside which fuels me to feel you inside more, it is a beautiful cycle of love.

This love, the love for you inside myself, manifests outwardly not just in the love I show you but in the love I show all. This love also fuels a deep gratitude for the love itself and for the ability to be a part of it as it flows through me. Just to be a vessel for such a powerful force is absolutely amazing. I am grateful for it all.

There is a huge power in us coming together, the force we continuously form. It is a true blessing. May we all enjoy it.

Beyond I, beyond you, I love you.
